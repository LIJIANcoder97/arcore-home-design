# arcore-home-design
这是我的本科毕设，一个AR家具购物平台，详细视频介绍见img文件夹。

This is my graduation project. The front-end of the project is developed using Flutter technology, utilizing the Arcore library to create augmented reality (AR) effects. The back-end is implemented using Java Servlet technology for setting up the server. The main feature of this project is the ability to place furniture in a real environment while browsing products, allowing users to compare and select the most suitable furniture for their space. The key tasks include:
  
  1. Developed the application's main interface using the Flutter Material design library, incorporating a sidebar, horizontal scrolling for product display, and adding a color gradient effect on click.

  2. Utilized Flutter packages such as flutter_staggered_grid_view to achieve a staggered grid layout and addressed rich text formatting using flutter_markdown.
  3. Utilizing Java Servlet and MySQL database in conjunction with the Flutter front-end to implement e-commerce features such as product search, placing orders, and adding items to shopping plans

  4. Leveraged channel methods to enable Flutter to communicate with a native Java AR library, effectively resolving the challenge of mixed development between Flutter and native languages and facilitating AR furniture display.
